F# Language Design RFCs 
=================

Gists and docs related to the F# langauge design process

Process:

1. Use [F# Language User Voice](http://fslang.uservoice.com) for ideas

2. Ideas which get "approved in principle" will get an [RFC entry](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/tree/master/RFCs) based on the [template](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/blob/master/RFC_template.md), and a corresponding [RFC discussion thread](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/issues)

3. Implementations and testing are usually submitted to the [visualfsharp](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pulls) repository
