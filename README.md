F# Language Design RFCs 
=================

Gists and docs related to the F# langauge design process

Process:

1. Use [F# Language User Voice](http://fslang.uservoice.com) for ideas

2. Ideas which get "approved in principle"  get an [RFC entry](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/tree/master/RFCs) based on the [template](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/blob/master/RFC_template.md), and a corresponding [RFC discussion thread](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/issues)

   There is currently a backlog of approved ideas. If an idea has been approved and you'd 
   like to accelerate the creation of an RFC,  send a PR creating the RFC document for any approved-in-principle issue.  
   First in first served.  To "grab the token" send a PR doing nothing but creating or naming the RFC file, and 
   then fill in the further details with additional commits to the PR.

3. Implementations and testing are usually submitted to the [visualfsharp](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pulls) repository
